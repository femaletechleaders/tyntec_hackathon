# Welcome to the FTL Chatbot Challenge Hackathon, hosted by Tyntec

![alt text](/resources/unicorn.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Bring your dream Chatbot to life, by using APIs built by tyntec.

**To get up and running ASAP follow the instructions [here](Get_set__GO!.md).**

Chatbots are changing the world. From customer service to ordering pizza, these electronic assistants are replacing humans in an increasing amount of services. They are built to enhance automated tasks using APIs, allowing computers and humans to interact in a simple way.

During this hackathon, FTL, together with tyntec, invite you to build your own Chatbot, and to interact with real life users. Using tyntec's communication APIs, you will be able to reach users in a secure way via SMS, Facebook messages, and Viber.

About tyntec:
tyntecâ€™s mission is to power human connection at scale. Using our cloud communications platform as the cornerstone, we build out network connections and communication APIs so that any businesses can use mobile communication to shape their interactions with people around the world. Today, that often involves enabling developers to add texting, phone number data, and authentication methods via powerful yet easy-to-use APIs.

Plus, tyntec is a tech company led by CEO Nicola Wolfram, which makes this collaborative hackathon even more special ;)

## What to bring
- A laptop (don't forget the power chord)
- Make sure your development environment is up and running ([this repo](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) is quite a slick setup for hackathons). It sucks to waste your precious time on that at the event.
- Earphones, since it might be noisy.
- Some warm and comfortable clothes.

#### **Optional**
- Cool gadgets like rasberry pi, arduino, amazon echo, 3D printer etc.
- Sleeping bag, pillow and inflatable mattress if you are sleeping over (we also have beanbags and couches to sleep on)

## Prizes

There are a bunch of cool prizes up for grabs, such as amazon echo dots, speakers and bluetooth headphones.

## Sleeping Over

 Hackers are invited to hack through the night and to sleep in tyntec's office. Feel free to bring your sleeping bags and pillows! 

## Judging Criteria


| Category                  | Weighting |
| --------------------------|:----:|
| Usefulness                | 35 |
| Creativity                | 25 |
| Technical sophistication  | 20 |
| Completion                | 15 |
| Presentation              |  5 |

While the presentation only has a very small weighting, it is important to remember that it has a much bigger influence overall. If you don't show us clearly what you did and why, it is difficult to judge your performance on the other criteria.
