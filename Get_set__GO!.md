## Getting Organised:

1. Join the [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ftl-tyntec-hackathon/shared_invite/enQtNDU2NzU1OTY5NTQxLWE2ZGFmNmMyOWYyOGNhNTk0MGU4ZTIyNjgxMjc5MGQxNDQ3NzE5YmI1MDc0MDQyNjE5ZGVjMDZkNDExZGZkNzA).

1. Have a look at the official [API Documentation](https://docs.tyntec.com/en/content/sms/http/) and the introduction to using [Postman](/resources/PostmanAndCollectionPresentation.pdf) or [curl](/resources/services-with-curl.md) with the tyntec API.

1. We will try to put all resources and updates in this github repository, so check here first if you have questions.

## Technical Setup:

 1. Life is better with Git.  [Install](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) it if you haven't yet. Also, if you prefer a user interface [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is great.

 1. If you don't already have a favorite IDE/Text editor use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), its what all the cool kids use.

 1. To play with the API you will either need [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or an even nicer option is [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps).

 1. Creating a nice project readme is a great way to show off your work. For this you my need some more [advanced markdown techniques](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links).
